A winter weekend in Milan. Freezing temperatures outdoors. A three-and-a-half year old bundle of energy waiting to head out on a weekend morning. Parents in deep thought.

How about the <a title="Acquario civico di Milano" href="http://www.acquariocivicomilano.eu/" target="_blank">Milan Aquarium</a>? It turned out to be a great decision on our part.

    Welcome to the Acquario civico di Milano.

A short ride in one of our favorite modes of transport, the tram, took us to one end of Parco Sempione, where the <a title="Acquario civico di Milano" href="http://www.acquariocivicomilano.eu/cms/" target="_blank">Milan Aquarium</a> is located.

This small aquarium, which offers free entry to all visitors, was a welcome respite from the bitter cold outside. We discovered that it was a source of wholesome entertainment and education to our son as well as many other kids who came visiting with their families.

A statue of Neptune at the entrance of the beautiful building captured our attention. Junior was fascinated by the little pond outside with several little fish and water gushing out of a hippo&#8217;s mouth.

Inside, each tank, with an informative description, represents one of the many aquatic ecosystems in Italy (such as the Alpine regions, springs, rivers, the coast).

I was mesmerized by the ray fish, as always. The scorpionfish was Junior&#8217;s favorite.

All the kids were having a whale of a time. The younger ones squealed with delight at the sight of the fish, while the older ones were very curious about the names and behavior of the aquatic residents.

We spent an interesting couple of hours here, and our little son thoroughly enjoyed the visit. He spent more time observing the little fish in the pond outside than the &#8216;special&#8217; ones in the tanks inside :). Well, that&#8217;s a kid for you! ðŸ™‚
