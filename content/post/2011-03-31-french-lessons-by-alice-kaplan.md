               The author takes the reader along on her journey of self-discovery as she determines her identity, her passion for the beautiful French language and her world encompassing everything French.

                I loved reading this book, and would highly recommend it to all Francophiles. From the immense  joy of pronoucing the &#8216;r&#8217; correctly to the travails of her research efforts, the author has described events in her life, in a very honest and refreshing way.
