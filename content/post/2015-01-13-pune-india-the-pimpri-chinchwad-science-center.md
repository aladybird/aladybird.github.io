The Pimpri-Chinchwad area, home to several major automobile companies, now has a Science Centre. Explore the world of automobiles, enjoy learning science in the &#8220;Fun Science&#8221; section, and walk among dinosaurs in the open Dinosaur Park. We spent a Sunday afternoon at the centre and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.

&nbsp;

The <a title="Pimpri-Chinchwad Science Park (Pimpri-Chinchwad Science Centre)" href="http://www.pcsciencepark.org/index.html" target="_blank">Pimpri-Chinchwad Science Centre</a> (or Pimpri-Chinchwad Science Park) is located near the Auto Cluster in Chinchwad. At the entrance, one can purchase general entry tickets to the science centre, as well as additional separate tickets for the 3D Science show and the Taramandal, an inflatable portable planetarium.

&nbsp;

**The World of Dinosaurs:**

Our visit got off to a good start with the &#8220;attractive&#8221; dinosaurs in the garden outside :). Ovisaurus, Ankylosaurus, Psittacosaurus, &#8230; However, Junior was disappointed at not being allowed to view the giants up close and personal. It was forbidden to walk on the lawn where the models are installed. As we learnt about each dinosaur from the information boards, Junior&#8217;s focus was on the food habits of the creatures.

**The Garden:**

The garden outside also has a range of play equipment demonstrating various concepts in science. The long pipe for communication was a hot favorite among children.

  Busts of illustrious Indian scientists such as Meghnad Saha, JC Bose, Satyendranath Bose, and Ramanujam lend a beautiful touch to the landscape.

**Fuel Up:**

A small cafe in the premises offers snacks and beverages if hunger pangs strike.

**VRRROOOOOM, The Automobile Section:**
  
No prizes for guessing where we spent most of our time. Junior was thrilled to see the exhibits in the Automobile Section, especially the interactive ones. From activating wipers to observing the working of an engine, Junior (and his parents, as a consequence :)) examined every vehicle and component several times and in great detail. With sponsorship from Tata Motors, Bajaj, Mahindra, SKF, this section is one of the highlights of the Science Centre.

We watched 3D videos in the auditorium, but skipped a visit to Taramandal, the planetarium. We will gaze at stars during our next visit here.
