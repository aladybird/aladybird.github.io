Well, this was a good month to catch up on some reading.

This October, I thoroughly enjoyed several afternoons curled up with &#8220;Le Temps des Secrets&#8221;, the third book in the series &#8220;Souvenirs d&#8217;Enfance&#8221; by Marcel Pagnol.

For intense and thought-provoking reading, I picked &#8220;L&#8217;Étranger&#8221; by Albert Camus from the library at Alliance Française.
