  &#8220;Let&#8217;sÂ catch upÂ over coffee!&#8221; said my long-lost childhood buddy. &#8220;Great idea!&#8221;, I instantly responded.

  Coffee and conversation &#8211; I wonder when I got addicted to this marvellous combination :)..
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  It must have been during college days. An inseparable group of four friends, weÂ used toÂ haveÂ long chats over &#8220;Filter coffee&#8221; at a then-popular restaurant, Surabhi, in the charming city of Pune. There was always something to talk about at the end of a long day at college. And the hot beverageÂ neverÂ failed to pep up our conversational mood.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  We graduated and moved toÂ different cities.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  In Raleigh, North Carolina,Â a coffee shop that I loved to frequent was Global Village Organic Coffee. My roommate and IÂ had endless tÃªte-Ã -tÃªtes over a steaming cuppa. Life away from family, new friends, weekend plans, shopping lists, stressfulÂ projects &#8211; the topics never ceased.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Another graduation, another city.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  CafÃ© Coffee Day (CCD)Â was increasinglyÂ becoming a popular hangoutÂ in Bangalore.Â Over Cappuccino andÂ CafÃ© Latte, my fiancÃ© and IÂ talked ofÂ our hopes, dreams and our future life together.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  A lovely wedding.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Coffee shops at every nook and corner in Bangalore.Â Lavazza, CCD, Brio, Qwikys, Mocha, Gloria Jeans Coffee, Costa Coffee, Cuppa&#8230;.whew!Â &#8211;Â an amazingly vastÂ choice forÂ our conversational spirits :). We&#8217;ve plannedÂ fun weekend getaways andÂ great family vacations,Â caught upÂ withÂ dear friends, made financial investment decisions, and of course, just plain chilled out over many a cup ofÂ Joe&#8230;
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  The best coffee I&#8217;ve had till date?
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  One for theÂ taste and one for the view.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  A steaming cup of the best Cappuccino I&#8217;ve ever had was at (no prizes for guessing) Rome, Italy.Â My husband and IÂ hopped into a little corner coffee storeÂ en routeÂ to the Spanish Steps and placed our order. The taste was absolutely fantastic, the cost very reasonable. The coffee &#8211; OUT OF THE WORLD! ğŸ™‚
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  The other was at (again, no prizes) a cafÃ© in Paris, where we leisurely sipped our &#8220;CafÃ© au lait&#8221; after a long day of exploring the vibrant city and watched the world go by. The coffee was very good, the cost, a tad high. The experienceÂ &#8211; OUT OF THE WORLD! ğŸ™‚
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Coffee,Â to me, is aÂ &#8220;must-have&#8221; companion for the conversational soul! ğŸ™‚
