  With a long weekend in sight, we put on our thinking caps to determine a not-so-far holiday destination. And the winner was&#8230;&#8230; Yercaud!
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Day 1:
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  About 230 km from Bangalore, the drive to Yercaud was a smooth one, with a great highway via Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri and Salem. From Salem, 20 hairpin bends led us to our final destination. No dearth of restaurantsÂ during the journey :).

</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  On reaching Yercaud shortly after noon, it was a simple effort to locate our hotel &#8211; Hotel Shevaroys. We checked-in into the Dahlia Room, and were mighty pleased with the cleanliness, comfort and layout of the room. The icing on the cake &#8211; a spacious sitout area with a beautiful view of the greenery, flowers and winged visitors :). Noisy red-whiskered bulbuls kept us company throughout our stay here. We couldn&#8217;t ask for more ðŸ™‚

Kids of all ages seemed to be having a gala time interacting with the geese in the complex and playing in the little children&#8217;s park. Intrigued by the &#8216;plantation walk&#8217; sign, we followed the directions and had a wonderful short walk in the small coffee plantation within the resort.

</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  It was great fun spottingÂ a bunch of birds, including flycatchers.Coffee plant flower buds were in abundance. We spent the rest of the evening strolling along the Yercaud lake and returned to the hotel in time to catch up with the World Cup cricket final match.

  Day 2:
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Morning coffee in the balcony with bulbuls for conversation company &#8211; It really is a funderful world! ðŸ™‚ Breakfast at the Silver Oak restaurant, and we set off to explore Yercaud. The Pagoda Point and Lady&#8217;s Seat offered nice views of the Shevaroy Hills.<a href="http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image010.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-81" title="Lady's Seat" src="http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image010.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://funderfulworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image010.jpg 648w, http://funderfulworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image010-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  In the evening, we enjoyed another leisurely walk near the lake and an adjoining park. And then, we headed to the Pear Tree Cafe, a quaint place that we had spotted in the morning. It turned out to be a great decision. A charming little place, managed by a friendly couple, with a splendid view of the Montfort School. Over Masala Chai, Sorsop, yummy mini-pizzas and fresh, tasty veg sandwiches, weÂ started planningÂ our next vacation :).
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Day 3:
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  WeÂ could notÂ resist another walk in the little plantation. This time, the coffee flowers had bloomed andÂ their fragrance was overwhelming. After check-out formalities, we visited the Shervarayan temple, another scenic drive through the hills. Admiring the views, we set off on our return journey, down the hairpin bends, via Salem, back home to Bangalore.<a href="http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image012.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83" title="Coffee full bloom" src="http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image012.jpg" alt="" width="529" height="396" srcset="http://funderfulworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image012.jpg 648w, http://funderfulworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image012-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" /></a>
