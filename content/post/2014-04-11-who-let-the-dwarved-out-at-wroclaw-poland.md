At the corner of a street. On a window sill. Outside a hotel. Beside a restaurant. At the zoo. Near the university. Everywhere. Anywhere.

The “dwarves” of Wroclaw (approximately 1 foot tall) were difficult to spot at first, but once we got started on our mission, it was an “eye-opening” one, literally :).

It took me a while to adjust my eyes to the right “visual frequency” but B mastered the art very quickly and would have willingly spent the entire weekend on his quest for these little people of Wroclaw. Junior had a gala time observing the figurines up close and personal and noting the details.

The origin of the dwarf statues dates back to 2001, when the first one came into existence as a symbol of the <a title="Orange Alternative Movement, Poland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Alternative" target="_blank">Orange Alternative</a> movement in Poland. Over the years, the number and popularity of the statues has increased and they are found outside several establishments.

A <a title="Official Website of Wroclaw Dwarves" href="http://krasnale.pl/en/" target="_blank">map of the dwarves of Wroclaw</a> is available; however, we preferred to take up the “challenge” of embarking on the trail of discovery without the map.

My favorite was the “sleeping dwarf” outside a hotel. B loved the “traveller dwarf”, while Junior was most amused by the dwarves outside an ATM.

A unique way to explore the Polish city of Wroclaw.
