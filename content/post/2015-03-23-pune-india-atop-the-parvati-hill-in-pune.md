Many years ago, I would often hike in the hills in the Sahakar Nagar neighborhood of Pune with my parents and sister. Sometimes, as a special treat to ourselves, we would cross several hills and reach the beautiful temple complex of Parvati, located on a hillock. At other times, we would go to Parvati the &#8220;official&#8221; way: climb approximately 80 steps from the main entrance near Mahila Mandal. And each time, the beauty of the temple complex and the views of the city from atop the hill made it a joyful experience.

It was time to relive the experience all over again!

On a recent evening, I convinced B and Junior to join me on a visit to the Parvati hill and temple complex. Junior was completely engrossed in counting the slightly steep but wide steps that lead to the top. We passed fitness enthusiasts, camera-wielding tourists, ardent devotees, and energetic kids on the way.

The beautiful complex atop the hill comprises several temples dating back to the era of the Peshwas. The Devdeveshwar temple at the summit can be seen from several areas in Pune. An elevated balcony around this temple offers panoramic views of the city.

Other temples in the complex are dedicated to Vitthal and Rukmini, Karthikeya, and Vishnu. A Peshwa museum and a memorial to Nanasaheb Peshwa are also present on the premises.

The tranquility of the location, the unhindered views of Pune, and the beautiful temples made quite an impression on us.

As I watched the sun go down and cast an orange glow over the city, I found myself in a reflective mood, transported back in history, imagining the scene here several hundred years ago, during the time of the Peshwas.

Visit Parvati to catch a lovely sunrise or sunset over the city of Pune and to reflect on a bit of history. Enjoy some quiet moments in the peaceful temple complex. Get some fresh air and a bit of exercise.
