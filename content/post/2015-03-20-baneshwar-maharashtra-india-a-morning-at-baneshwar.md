We headed to Baneshwar on a Saturday morning. The small charming temple is surrounded by a forest, and hence the name _&#8216;Baneshwar&#8217;_. In the temple premises, Junior was drawn to a couple of tanks and their inhabitants (turtles and fish).

&nbsp;

Outside the temple, several walking paths trace routes through the green environs; one of these paths leads to a waterfall. The tall trees provided a cool cover from the heat and we enjoyed a pleasant stroll. Junior loved the abundance of open space here and engaged in one of his favorite activities &#8211; climbing trees. You can climb the watchtowers at various locations for a view of the surrounding areas and the hills in the distance.

Unfortunately, when we visited, the waterfall was almost completely dry and ready to receive this year&#8217;s monsoon showers.

We spent a couple of hours walking around and exploring the children&#8217;s park, several picnic spots, a garden, a nursery, and a small museum with information about the flora and fauna of the region.

If you are looking to spend a few hours at a serene location, add Baneshwar to your list!

&#8211; Baneshwar is situated about 40 km from Pune (approximately an hour by car). To reach Baneshwar, take the Pune-Satara highway and turn (right) at the village of Nasarapur. The temple is located approximately 1.5 &#8211; 2 km from the highway.

&#8211; A nominal fee is charged for entry to the surrounding forest area.

&#8211; Bring a picnic lunch if you&#8217;d like and enjoy it at one of the tranquil green spots.
