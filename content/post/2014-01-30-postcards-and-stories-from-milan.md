I&#8217;ve always loved walking around a city or town to explore it. Sometimes with a destination in mind, sometimes without. Sometimes in a happy mood, sometimes in a sad one. Sometimes brimming with energy, sometimes a bit tired. Sometimes in sunny weather, sometimes in the rain. Sometimes for an hour, sometimes for hours. And every little journey brings with it a little souvenir &#8211; of people, of places, of conversations, of discovery.

In Milan, I hop on to a tram or bus or metro sometimes to go that extra distance. In this series, I will share postcards and stories from these small journeys that bring great delight to the _wandering spirit_ in me :).
