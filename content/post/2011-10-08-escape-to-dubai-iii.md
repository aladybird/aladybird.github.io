  Having spent a lovely two days in Dubai(read <a title="Escape to Dubai â€“ I" href="http://funderfulworld.com/thetravelbug/escape-to-dubai/" target="_blank">Escape to Dubai &#8211; I</a> and <a title="Escape to Dubai â€“ II" href="http://funderfulworld.com/thetravelbug/escape-to-dubai-ii/" target="_blank">Escape to Dubai &#8211; II</a>), we looked forward to the sights and sounds that the last day had in store for us.

  Day 3:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  At the glitzy <a title="The Dubai Mall" href="http://www.thedubaimall.com/en" target="_blank">Dubai Mall</a>,Â our first stop wasÂ at the kiddie cart rentalÂ store. The youngest member of our family was overjoyed on seeing a bright yellow taxi, and it was his for the next few hours :). Our routine at a mall was pretty much established by now: rent a kiddie car(t), grab a map, select the destinations(stores/attractions), head there, return the kiddie car(t), head to the taxi parking/metro station.

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Passing numerous stores and window-shopping on the way, we caught a glimpse of <a title="The Waterfall at Dubai Mall" href="http://www.thedubaimall.com/en/news/media-centre/news-section/the-dubai-mall-opens-the-waterfall-a-spectacular-water-feature-and-vantage-meeting-point-for-visitor.html" target="_blank">The Waterfall</a>. We walked towards it for a closer look. It isÂ definitely anÂ impressive piece of work! Several photographs later, it was time for a cuppa :D. No dearth of coffee shops here.

  Book World by KinokuniyaÂ is a huge bookstore with a very vast collection. We spent a good deal of time browsing the various sectionsÂ of this gallery. I was in the French section for the most part, looking for a good buy. The &#8216;men of the house&#8217; explored the other parts of the store.Â This is a must-visit for all book-lovers!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We were getting used to losing our way inside every mall. It can be a fun experience, though, as long as you are not on a tight schedule. We had all the time in the world. As we wandered around trying to determine the way to the cart rental store, we reached the super-glitzy Fashion Avenue. From Alexander McQueen and Chanel to Louis Vuitton and Versace, you will find them all here. Feeling a &#8220;little&#8221; out-of-place outside the designer stores and in the &#8220;highly fashionableÂ area&#8221; :)),Â but having a great time looking around, we walked past the Armani/Dubai Caffe and finally, reached our destination.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In the afternoon, we took the metro train to Ibn Battuta station, a long distance away. This ride gave us the perfect opportunity to see more of Dubai: the Safa Park, the Burj Al Arab from a distance, many beautiful (and undoubtedly, tallÂ :))Â buildings along Shaikh Zayed Road and the Ibn Battuta Mall.Â ItÂ was outside the Ibn Battuta station thatÂ some signs of the desert (sand) land were visible :). In many areas, construction is still on, cranes are at work (someone said that the crane is considered to be the national bird of dubai :D) and there&#8217;s still land under development.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to take a ride on the Palm Jumeirah Monorail. But, hey, there&#8217;s always a next time! ðŸ™‚
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Our trip was coming to an end. It had been a lovely vacation, there was so much to do &#8216;indoors&#8217; in Dubai. We will return for all the &#8216;outdoor&#8217; activities, in winter (hopefully, that&#8217;ll happen soon!). The next visit will likely include Jumeirah Beach Park, the Palm Jumeirah Monorial, the Creekside Park, the Walk at JBR and a ride into the desert.
