**&#8220;It&#8217;s the Little Things&#8221;** by **Craig Wilson** is an absolutely delightful book with many short stories.

A friend had gifted it to me almost 10 years ago. I spotted it a few weeks ago, and picked it up for another read.

If you need to recharge your spirits or just &#8220;feel good&#8221; about the little things in life, &#8220;It&#8217;s the Little Things&#8221; is a perfect reading choice.
