I stood in front of theÂ bookshelf, wondering what to read. Suddenly, I glanced at a new addition, Totto-chan The Little Girl at the Window. Intrigued by the title, I took a closer look and the illustration on the cover added to my fascination. For the next couple of days, I was unable to stop thinking about the book. Each time I took a break from reading it, I would pick it up again almost immediately.

Every simple chapter has a thought-provoking lesson, one that we could all relate to. The vivid description and interesting anecdotes weave a tale of innocence and maturity, learning and teaching, fun times and serious incidents.

ThisÂ beautifully written (and well-translated)Â story of a little girl&#8217;s formative years at school brought a great deal of positive energy and happiness to me. Student or teacher, child or parent, this book is a wonderful read for everyone.

Do read it, and I&#8217;d love to discuss it with you! ðŸ™‚
