We followed the signs to a small ticket counter. Before we could say &#8220;Timbuktu&#8221;, we had paid for the tickets and were hurrying along to a &#8220;show&#8221; that had just started.

A miniature scene. With trains that chug along the tracks and a hot air balloon rising high. With a funicular and cable car that compete for attention. With tiny people enjoying a swim and others scaling a mountain.

For approximately 20-25 minutes, a (full-size) person in the control room brings a miniature city alive. The English commentary offers a description of every feature but is nearly drowned out by excited squeals from the kids watching the show.

Located on the G.A. Kulkarni Road in the Kothrud area of Pune, <a title="Joshi's Museum of Miniature Railways, Pune" href="http://www.minirailways.com/" target="_blank">Joshi&#8217;s Museum of Miniature Railways</a> is tucked away in a hall on the first floor of a building. The show is held for a minimum of four persons.

We enjoyed the show and the detail in the miniature landscape. However, for us, the duration was a bit too short. A train-loving family needs some more time in such a place :D. As visitors for the next show trooped in, Junior was quite reluctant to leave the hall (&#8220;So soon, mamma?&#8221;).
