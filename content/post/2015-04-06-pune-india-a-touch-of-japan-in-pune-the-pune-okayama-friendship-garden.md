Looking for a change of scenery on the busy Sinhagad Road?

The Pune-Okayama Friendship Garden (or Pu La Deshpande Udyan), located on Sinhagad Road in Pune, is a welcome visual treat. It is based on the Korakuen Garden in Okayama City and was inaugurated in 2006.

B has a special fondness for everything J (read Japanese), and so, as we entered the garden, he was on a high. We strolled along the paths in the well landscaped and vast green space, and crossed the little bridges over streams flowing through the garden. Junior was delighted to spot Koi fish in the pond but he was quite disappointed that stepping on the grass was prohibited.

A group of wagtails splashed around at the water&#8217;s edge, while a lone red-wattled lapwing hopped around frantically on a small island. We walked up the hillock just as the sun began to set. Inspite of the large number of weekend visitors, a tranquil atmosphere prevailed (occasionally interrupted by the warning whistles from security personnel ensuring adherence to the rules).

We walked some more, and I would have loved to find a seat and spend some more time in the verdant surroundings. However, Junior was keen on heading to the kids&#8217; play area next.

And so, we proceeded to the slides, swings, and see-saws!
  
The play area adjoining the garden is a delight for kids. Entry to this zone is free and the play equipment appeared quite safe and modern.

&nbsp;

Spend a morning or evening at this beautifully designed green space and recharge yourself!
