  With 2 out of 3 members in our family being CRAZY about flying machines, it was a no-brainer to head to the HAL Aerospace Museum at Bangalore on a sunny Sunday morning. Located on Old Airport Road, this museum is open from 9 am to 5 pm every day of the week.

  A bevy of stunning aircraft vie for attention, and the well-kept lawns and garden provide a beautiful green landscape in the background. (It&#8217;s ironic how the best-looking lawns always have the signboard &#8220;Please do not walk on the lawn&#8221;! 🙁 ) The MIG and IJT elicited squeals from our youngest family member, while the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) and Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) mesmerized the eldest :).  Marveling at the earliest versions of choppers as well as the latest indigenous ones, I dreamed of an opportunity to fly one (or atleast, fly IN one!). Well, someday&#8230;.

  A little cafeteria with seating outdoors offers the perfect little break. We stopped at the little pond to gaze at its brightly-colored inhabitants swimming helter-skelter. Well, our little companion made several stopovers at the pond!

  In addition, there are two exhibition halls &#8211; one with models of aircraft and engines on display, the other with a vast collection of photographs depicting the history of HAL and its growth till date.

  A fun way to spend a couple of hours, especially if you love those magnificent flying machines.
