Well, among other experiments with social media, I tried my hand at creating a Facebook page for this blog yesterday. Although I thought it would be a breeze, there were a couple of minor glitches.

All resolved in good time (<a title="Publicizing WordPress blogs using Social Media" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/" target="_blank">tips from WordPress support</a>Â for linking blogs with social media), and hey, It&#8217;s a Funderful World has a Facebook page now!

All new posts and other updates will also show up at:Â <http://www.facebook.com/ItsAFunderfulWorld>.

Open to &#8216;likes&#8217;, &#8216;comments&#8217; and &#8216;shares&#8217;. Happy reading! ðŸ™‚
