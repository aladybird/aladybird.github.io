Maharashtra is blessed with a beautiful coastline dotted with many sandy beaches.

This winter, we spent a few days at Karde beach (near Dapoli) in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. Our daily routine included morning swims in the blue sea, long walks on the beach to greet sandpipers and plovers, building complex structures in the sand, and watching the sun set over the Arabian sea.

&nbsp;

**The Journey:**
  
It took us approximately five hours to reach Karde from Pune by road. We chose the Bhor Ghat during our onward journey and halted for a tea break at a scenic location in the ghats.
  
During the return journey, we opted for the Tamhini Ghat-Mulshi route, another picturesque journey.

**Morning Walks and Swims:**
  
The highlights of our pleasant morning walks on the beach were the encounters with feathered friends and the small number of people around. Sometimes, crowds gather for the dolphin-watching and other boat tours, but this happens at just one spot along the beach, thus leaving the tranquility of most parts of the beach undisturbed.

Swim and splash in the coolÂ waters, watch the boats sail on, ride the waves, play frisbee.

Outside the water, much of our time was spent building tall and fancy structures in the sand. Junior was at his artistic and architectural best here :).

**Around Karde:**
  
Some afternoons, we enjoyed a siesta :).
  
One afternoon, we drove to Anjarle. This scenic route through the mountains offers many spectacular views.

We stopped at a view point on the way &#8211; from here, the small hamlet of Pachpadhari was visible along the shore and the Suvarnadurg sea fort rose majestically in the shimmering waters of the Arabian Sea.

We continued driving to the **Anjarle Ganesh temple**, a small, charming temple in the mountains. Junior spent considerable time at the temple tank, counting turtles.

**Evening Strolls and Sunsets:**
  
During our evening strolls along the beach, we looked for shells, observed the fascinating rocks and everything on them, and watched crabs scurry away. Then, we found ourselves a suitable seat to watch the sunset show. A marvellous way to end a day at Karde!

After sunset, we often gazed at the twinkling lights &#8211; of the nearby fishing village, Harne; of fishing boats out in the sea; of constellations up in the sky.
