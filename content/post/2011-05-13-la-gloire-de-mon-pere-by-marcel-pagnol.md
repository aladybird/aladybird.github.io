A delightful narrative about the events that unfold during a summer of the author&#8217;s childhood.

With beautiful descriptions of the French countryside, hilarious narration of complicated situations that the family finds itself in and an excellent account of the complex emotions in a family,  particularly between the father and son, this is a fun-filled book.

I love Marcel Pagnol&#8217;s writing style in this book. Simple and yet, so wonderfully descriptive, it brings to the fore, lovely childhood memories.

I am definitely looking forward to reading more books from the same author.
