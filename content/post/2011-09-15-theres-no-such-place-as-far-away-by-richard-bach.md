  &#8220;Once upon a time, in a land far far away..&#8221; &#8211; Most books that I read during my early childhood would begin in this way. And so, when I recently spotted the title &#8216;There&#8217;s No Such Place As Far Away&#8217;, I was definitely intrigued. Even more so by the book&#8217;s fine layout and few number of pages.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  Richard Bach uses simple vocabulary and a common situation to set our minds thinking about a complex perception. What does &#8216;far away&#8217; mean? Each character in this story poses a unique question that requires deep introspection to find a meaningful answer.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  I am still searching for a response.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    Meanwhile, I have more questions. Pondering over the message of this book, I wonder aloud &#8211;
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    Is &#8216;far away&#8217; a measurement of the physical distance that separates us from someone? Does the Internet truly impact this definition in that case?
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    Is it influenced by the emotions and feelings shared with another being?
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    Could you be so emotionally &#8216;connected&#8217; with someone you love that you are always together, and there is no such place as far away?
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align:left;">
    This book is a quick read and provides food for thought.
