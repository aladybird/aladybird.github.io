  I lay on the hospital bed, staring into space, wide awake at midnight.Â Inspite ofÂ theÂ painkiller and sedative, sleep eluded me.Â I wasÂ exhausted, longing to get some shuteye.Â Why was it so tough to fall asleep?
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">
  I missed a tiny being, who was at home at this moment. Not very far away BUT it was the first time in 17 months that a little angelÂ did not cuddle up to me at night.Â Â The tiny hands that curled around mine, the stubborn demands for one more song, the innumerable goodnight kisses&#8230;. I missed all that.Â Would he miss me too? Would he wonder where his mommy was that night? Would he sleep okay? In my drowsy state, I had not even said a proper goodbye when heÂ was leavingÂ the hospital. Gosh, too many thoughts. I needed to get some sleep!

  Of course, he would be fine. Thank God for his awesome dad andÂ his caring grand-parents. Of course, I was going to be fine, too. Thank God for the great doctors and the kind nurses who will ensure that.

  I miss you tonight, my baby.

  The next morning, bright and sunny, a cheerful little fellow with a wide grinÂ ran intoÂ my room screaming,Â &#8220;AMMA!&#8221;. ðŸ™‚
