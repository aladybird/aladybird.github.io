**A Much-awaited Trip**

The UNESCO world heritage site of Ellora isÂ aÂ weekend escape or long-weekend getawayÂ from Pune.Â The splendid rock-cut caves had been on our wish list for quite some time. Along came the opportunity to pay a visit to this famous location.

Of the 34 rock-cut caves at Ellora, 17 are Hindu caves (cave numbers 13Â toÂ 29), 12 are Buddhist caves (cave numbersÂ 1-12), and 5 are Jain caves (cave numbersÂ 30-34).

OnÂ our journey of discovery, in addition to the Hindu caves, the caves dedicated to Buddhism and Jainism left an indelible impression on our minds.

**The Buddhist Caves: MasterpiecesÂ in Stone**

The &#8220;Do Tal&#8221; and &#8220;Teen Tal&#8221; are multi-level caves. As we explored each level, we came face-to-face with impressive sculptures of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Â The Carpenter&#8217;s Cave or _Sutar Jhopadi_ (cave 10) isÂ the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of the Buddhist group of caves. AÂ high vaulted ceiling, magnificentÂ carvings that resembleÂ wooden beamsÂ andÂ aÂ majestic Buddha statue are the highlights of this masterpiece. In the _chaitya griha_, we were treated to a beautifulÂ rendition of the _Buddham Saranam Gacchami_ chant by a guide (it was intended for some VIP guests, and, as luck would have it, we were present at that time! ğŸ™‚ ). TheÂ soothing chant rippled throughÂ the silent hall and magnified the intensity of our wonder and amazement. A fantastic experience! In a trance, we proceeded to the other caves.Â Junior was intrigued by the goddess in one of the sculpturesÂ in Cave 6. Mahamayuri, the Buddhist deityÂ of learning, is flanked byÂ a peacock. Outside, aÂ small waterfall flowed down the rocky hillside near the southern end of the Buddhist caves. It lent a special, almost magical, effect to the scene.

**The Jain Caves: OrnateÂ Art in Stone**

After visitingÂ the Hindu and Buddhist caves, we were quite tired (having walked for several hours and having exploredÂ almost every nook of every cave). I even wondered aloud aboutÂ the option ofÂ visiting the remaining caves the next day. Junior, to my surprise, admonished me for even considering that thought! HeÂ was enthusiastic about continuing our exploration and seemed determined to visit the last group. And so it was decided. We took an autorickshaw to the Jain group of caves, located at the northern end of the complex.

Although the Jain caves are relatively smaller,Â the ornate and detailed art in theseÂ caves is a delight to the eyes. Fragments of colored art are still visible, leaving the grandeur of the original work to our imagination. The intricate designs and beautiful sculptures of GomatesvaraÂ andÂ the Tirthankaras capture the visitor&#8217;s attention.Â It was a fitting finale to a wonderful day of exploration.

  <div>
    &#8211; The Ellora caves complex is closed to visitors on Tuesday
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; Autorickshaws are available for touring the caves. The Hindu and the Buddhist caves can be covered by foot. They extend on either side of the main entrance to the complex. However,Â the Jain group of caves is approximately 2 kilometers away from the main complex and it is convenient to hire an auto to get there.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8211; There is a small restaurant outside the complex. We preferred to carryÂ a packed lunch.
