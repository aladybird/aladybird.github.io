      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  After a lovely &lt;a title=&#34;Cool Coonoor: A Cloudful of Memories (Part I)&#34; href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.wordpress.com/2011/11/23/cool-coonoor-a-cloudful-of-memories-part-i/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first day at Coonoor&lt;/a&gt;, we looked forward to what the next day had in store for us.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Hiking through Coonoor &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  It rainedÂ through the night, and there was a slight drizzle outside when we awoke. After breakfast, the drizzle had stopped, and we enthusiastically set off on a HIKE through Coonoor. It was a beautiful day, cloudy, cool, and perfect for a loooong walk in the hills.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  The route for this hikeÂ had beenÂ recommended byÂ a friend.Â He had given us a hand-sketched map, and we followed the directions. Unfortunately, we missedÂ a turn, and continued onward onÂ the wrong path. Soon, we were looking for a post office and Darlington bridge, but no there was no sign of either landmark :(. We passed the Taj resort, and soon realized that we were probably on a completely wrong route.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  We backtracked our way, and were elatedÂ when weÂ spotted the post office!! It wasÂ about 2 km of extra distance travelled due to our oversight. But hey, itÂ had beenÂ fun, nevertheless. We reached Darlington Bridge, our next landmark. So far, so good. Crossing the bridge, we followed signboards with directions to Lamb&amp;#8217;s Rock. WeÂ walked along a bendÂ in the road, and VOILÃ€ &amp;#8211; was this HEAVEN?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_606&#34; style=&#34;width: 308px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0602.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-606&#34; title=&#34;Spectacular views, Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0602.jpg?w=298&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;298&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Spectacular views, Coonoor
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  The most scenic landscape greeted us!! Tea estates surrounded us, and clouds floated in the valley below. We walked along, totally immersed in the marvellous views all around. At Singara Tea Estate, weÂ halted forÂ a tea break. This estate is owned by none other than Bollywood actress, Mumtaz.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The Jungle&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Resuming the hike, we were in completely different surroundings soon. We were passing through a thick jungle,Â where insects were making very shrill noises. An extremely high decibel level! The vegetation was so thick that whenÂ we looked up sometimes,Â we couldn&amp;#8217;t tell if it was day or night.Â A hostÂ of tourist vehicles sped past, with folks casting curious glances at us.Â A few small temples dotted the route. Some time later, we reached Lamb&amp;#8217;s Rock view point.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_607&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0605.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-607&#34; title=&#34;Sleeping Lady&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0605.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;156&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Sleeping Lady, Coonoor. Do you see a resemblance? ðŸ™‚
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  From here, we spotted a mountain called &amp;#8220;Sleeping Lady&amp;#8221; (supposedly resembles its namesake, butÂ we could think of several otherÂ objects/shapes that the mountain resembled!). We munched on the sandwiches that we had packed, a little picnic lunch for us.Â On spotting a bus stop nearby, weÂ waited there, for a bus ride to Dolphin&amp;#8217;s Nose. It was a long wait for the vehicle.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_609&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0608.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-609&#34; title=&#34;Hiking in Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0608.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;191&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Hiking in Coonoor - Glorious views
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  However, with theÂ gloriousÂ scenery around, it was one of the rare instances when we did not mind waiting one bit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Dolphin&amp;#8217;s Nose &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Along came the bus andÂ it transported us toÂ Dolphin&amp;#8217;s Nose. From there, itÂ was a 1 kilometre walk to the view point. WeÂ hiked through tea gardens, romancing the clouds on our way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_610&#34; style=&#34;width: 304px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0616.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-610&#34; title=&#34;Clouds in Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0616.jpg?w=294&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;294&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Our rendezvous with the clouds, Coonoor
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Yes, clouds floated by, in our face, and it would be a complete understatement to say that we enjoyed this walk. It was truly OUT-OF-THE-WORLD. At the view point, there was no dolpin in sight ;). Well, there was a white cloud blanket all around. We found a perch for ourselves, and had the clouds for company. It isÂ a wonderfulÂ feeling when the cold wetness ofÂ a cloud touches your face.Â We just sat there at Dolphin&amp;#8217;s Nose, enjoyingÂ our rendezvous with the clouds :).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_611&#34; style=&#34;width: 305px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0617.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34; wp-image-611&#34; title=&#34;Peering through the clouds, Dolphin&#39;s Nose, Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0617.jpg?w=295&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;295&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Peering through the clouds at Dolphin&#39;s Nose, Coonoor
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  A little later,Â a light drizzle started. A cup of &lt;em&gt;masala&lt;/em&gt; tea and some corn provided the icing on the cake!! ðŸ™‚ We walked back to the bus stop, armed with an umbrella, completely thrilled with this experience. A lengthy wait for the bus to arrive, but hey, there was plenty more scenery to admire in the meanwhile :). The clouds receded, and revealedÂ breathtaking views of the town of Mettupalayam in the valley.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  By the way, the Airtel cellphone signal was at full strength at this place :), quite impressive! The bus arrived, and we headed back to Coonoor town. On the way, weÂ caught a glimpse ofÂ Kattery waterfalls.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Back at the club, we decided to explore the area around. WeÂ strolled along charming streets and saw the other side of Coonoor &amp;#8211; schools, churches, buildings from the British era. It was a lovely evening walk through the town. Dinner at Hotel SreeLakshmi followed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;So long!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  The end of a great time at Coonoor, it was time to bidÂ goodbye to this lovely hill station with its narrow winding roads (that took our breath away, literally :)), beautiful tea estates and fantastic views. The next morning, we headed to Coimbatore by bus. We were pretty much used to the hairpin bends now, and not so nervous this time. We will definitely return to Coonoor. Walking through the clouds here is a &amp;#8220;never-to-be-forgotten&amp;#8221; experience for us. From Coimbatore, weÂ traveled back to Bangalore by the InterCity Express, taking back with us, a &amp;#8220;cloudful&amp;#8221; of experiences and memories.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cool Coonoor: A Cloudful of Memories (Part I)</title>

      <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;&#34;&gt;Every time I think of Coonoor, a charming little town in the Nilgiris, a cloudful of beautiful memories floats by. A few years ago, we spent a long weekend there.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_574&#34; style=&#34;width: 305px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0583.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-574&#34; title=&#34;Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0583.jpg?w=295&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;295&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Coonoor beckons
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steep slopes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  We reached Coimbatore in the early hours of the morning, after an overnight train journey by the Kanyakumari Express from Bangalore. Hurriedly gulping down some breakfast and tea, we took an auto to the bus stand. State Government buses to Ooty via Coonoor departed from here at regular intervals. Pretty soon, we boarded one of these buses, ready for a 4-hour ride. The last segment of this bus journey was a very picturesque one through the mountains, passing numerous hairpin bends. The bus driver drove very fast and we spotted him looking away from the road on several occasions, making us very nervous. We tried hard to find out what he was distracted by &amp;#8211; turned out that he was busy choosing the music that he wanted to play next. Definitely not music to our ears! With our hearts in our mouths, we prayed at every hairpin bend. As we neared our destination, beautiful tall trees beckoned us to the lovely hill station, Coonoor.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Coonoor Club&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Hopping into an auto, we headed to the Coonoor Club, where we planned to stay for the next couple of days. Located very close to Sim&amp;#8217;s Park, this place was very comfortable. After a great lunch, we set off to explore Coonoor by car.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;mceTemp mceIEcenter&#34; style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;dl class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
    &lt;dt class=&#34;wp-caption-dt&#34;&gt;
      &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_05641.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-577&#34; title=&#34;Driving through Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_05641.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;159&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/dt&gt;
    
    &lt;dd class=&#34;wp-caption-dd&#34;&gt;
      Picture perfect, Coonoor
    &lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Ralliah Dam&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Our first destination was the Ralliah Dam.Â We drove through tea estates, passing several small villages on the way. Women in these villages wore a unique type of headgear. As we approached the dam, a few fallen trees blocked the way, butÂ our guideÂ skillfully moved these aside. There were awesome views all around!! The first view of the dam and its surroundings was spectacular. The Ralliah Dam is a small reservoir, with calm water &amp;#8211; a picture of absolute serenity. The foundation stone of Ralliah dam was laid in 1938, and it was inaugurated in 1941. It is surrounded by lush green meadows. In the distance, buffaloes grazed. We walked along the dam and then sat by the water, completely immersed in the tranquil surroundings.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_580&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0568.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-580&#34; title=&#34;Ralliah Dam, Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0568.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;190&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Tranquil settings, Ralliah Dam
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Beulah Farm&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  We had to tear ourselves away from the peaceful environs of theÂ dam to visit Beulah Farm. Beulah farm had a wide variety of herbs, fruits and flowers. The owner welcomed us, andÂ very soon, Â a jam-tasting session followed :). There were 7 varieties of jam, made from plants grown at the farm. Our instant favourite was the &amp;#8220;rhubarb&amp;#8221; jam. One big bottle, please ðŸ™‚ (Our order was placed). The wine-tasting session was next. However, we chose to explore the farm instead. We were taken on a very interesting tour through the farm. We were introduced to a wide variety of plants &amp;#8211; Rhubarb, Lemongrass, Chive, Rosemary, Lavender, Strawberry, Bayleaf, Tulsi, Mint, Peppino, Avocado, Pear, Plum, Peach, Mom-in-law&amp;#8217;s Tongue (take a guess about its appearance ðŸ™‚ ), Dancing Fuschia, Orchid, Roses of every colour (even black and green! ), JetPlane Cactus (this one bore a striking resemblance to a jetplane)&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;. LOOOOONG LIST already, and there were many more. WHEW!! We did not know some of these even existed! Jimmy, the owner&amp;#8217;s dog, dozed away while we explored every nook and corner. As our visit was coming to an end, he woke up and we introduced ourselves :). At the entrance to the farm, is a rock, named Moby Dick &amp;#8211; no prizes for guessing the origin of the name. Well, must say &amp;#8211; it definitely resembled a whale! We had a whale of a time at Beulah Farm:)!!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Tea-Time!! &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_585&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0581.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-585&#34; title=&#34;Tea estate, Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0581.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;191&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Greeeeeen, as far as the eye can see
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Cuppa &lt;em&gt;chai&lt;/em&gt;? Next halt &amp;#8211; theÂ Tea factory. Inside the factory, we were shown the various stages ofÂ manufacturing tea, and the elaborate machinery that is used for the process. Do you know: 4 kg of tea leaves generate 1 kg of tea. A couple of cups of &lt;em&gt;chai&lt;/em&gt;, and some photo sessions in the tea estate followed. From here, we had a great view of a Golf Club and people playing cricket in the valley. It is said that a single tea plant lasts for a hundred years!!! Well, after hundred years, you can only plant another tea plant there since the soil turns acidic. Silver oak trees are grown in the midst of tea estates to act as sponges for mopping excess water. The tea plant requires very little water, but the water supply has to be continuous and thus, requires a slope. (Source ofÂ our fact file &amp;#8211;Â our guide and the employeesÂ in the tea factory)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Sim&amp;#8217;s Park&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;attachment_582&#34; style=&#34;width: 310px&#34; class=&#34;wp-caption aligncenter&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0595.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-582&#34; title=&#34;Sim&#39;s Park, Coonoor&#34; src=&#34;http://funderfulworld.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/100_0595.jpg?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;141&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  
  &lt;p class=&#34;wp-caption-text&#34;&gt;
    Sim&#39;s Park, Coonoor
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  After a splendid drive through Coonoor,Â we took a leisurely strollÂ in Coonoor&amp;#8217;s BotanicalÂ Garden, Sim&amp;#8217;s Park, observing some interesting botanical specimens like the &amp;#8220;bat flower&amp;#8221; on our way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Coonoor Downtown&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  Tons of buses connected various parts of Coonoor at a down-to-earth price of Rs 2 per ride per person. We took a bus downtown. The roadsÂ were extremely narrow, and very steep. It was interesting to see the techniques employed by theÂ bus drivers on these slopes, when buses came face to face on bends. We wereÂ quite nervous initially, but soon, got the hang of things, and took it easy :). Downtown, we explored a few shops, had dinner at SreeLaxmi restaurant, and headed back to Coonoor Club. This was theÂ first of several mealsÂ we wouldÂ enjoy at SreeLaxmi restaurant.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align:left;&#34;&gt;
  A beautifulÂ hike, and our rendezvous with clouds, in the next post, &lt;a title=&#34;Cool Coonoor: A Cloudful of Memories (PartÂ II)&#34; href=&#34;http://funderfulworld.wordpress.com/2011/11/26/cool-coonoor-a-cloudful-of-memories-part-ii/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cool Coonoor: A Cloudful of Memories (Part II)&lt;/a&gt;.
